               entity may potentially offer.  The value is a sum.
               This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for
               each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node
               performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added
               to the sum.  For example, a node which performs only
               routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)).
               In contrast, a node which is a host offering application
               services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)).
               Note that in the context of the Internet suite of
               protocols, values should be calculated accordingly:

                    layer      functionality
                      1        physical (e.g., repeaters)

                      3        internet (e.g., supports the IP)
